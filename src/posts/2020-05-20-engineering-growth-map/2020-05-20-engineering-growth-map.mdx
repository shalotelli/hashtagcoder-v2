Becoming a great engineer doesn't happen by chance. Aside from continuing to develop technical skills, it takes support, focus and direction. As I've discussed previously about [being an effective contributor](https://www.hashtagcoder.dev/blog/senior-software-engineer/) and [being a great leader](https://www.hashtagcoder.dev/blog/director-of-engineering/), having clear growth opportunities is an extremely important piece of a [healthy engineering culture](https://www.hashtagcoder.dev/blog/engineering-culture). 

One thing that's become very apparent to me over the years is that engineers value learning new things over other almost any other motivator. That's why I always focus on [the people and the problem](https://www.hashtagcoder.dev/blog/people-problem-pay/) when I'm helping others with their careers. But this comes with balance. To learn more, we have to get more insights and to get more insights we have to work their way up the organizational chart. However as we go up that org chart, our responsibilities naturally become more about mentorship and focus on others contributions. For this reason, it's important for leaders to create a structure that nurtures continued learning at every level.

If you want to build something great, it starts with great people. The responsibility of every organization is to cultivate an environment where engineers can challenge themselves and each other, can achieve their personal and professional goals and are set up for success. To embody these principles on my team, we've developed a set of norms, frameworks and processes to support the engineers as they grow their careers and take on more responsibility. These guiding principals pave the path for professional growth regardless of personal aspiration. They create a clear and mutual contract between leaders and contributors to align goals and purpose with the organization's mission.

# Guiding Principles

**Multi-track Progression**

Engineers and Engineering Managers are on distinct paths. Some engineers have core competencies that are suited more to project management and architecture. Others are more suited to people management. Making this explicit ensures engineers can grow their career and take on more responsibility without feeling like they have to become managers and stop doing the things they love. Although there are overlaps, the skills and motivations necessary to be successful in these different roles are totally different.

**Right Person, Right Seat**

I don't promote the hardest worker or the engineer that's been on the team the longest. The biggest mistake that I see leaders make is measuring individuals by output alone. Instead, I promote the engineer that demonstrates they get, want and can do whats expected from them at the next level. I believe in the concept of doing and asking for forgiveness, instead of asking for permission. Once I see someone taking on or being able to handle additional responsibility, this is formalized with a promotion.

An example of this is a mid-level contributor that starts thinking outside of their own contributions. Instead of thinking "I need to meet my sprint goals", they start taking ownership of their teams commitment and change their mentality to, "I need to help the team meet their sprint goals". This change in attitude is demonstrated through initiatives like clear and transparent communication, pair programming and constantly asking the right questions to get a pulse on progress. This mindset shows clear understanding of leadership and this responsibility is formalized so that the engineer feels empowered and values their voice.

# An Example Engineering Team Growth Map

The best way to pave this golden path is by explicitly setting out expectations on both sides. 

**For leaders** - A well defined growth map should be used in mentorship opportunities to focus on growth and potential. Use it to make sure you're putting the right people in the right seats so you ensure you're setting them up for success.

**For engineers** - This should be a reference point to understand how others have been successful and to help you set your own goals based on what you want to achieve in your own career. Reference these points during 1-1 conversations and measure your own success to how well you're tracking towards the stated expectations not only for your current role, but for subsequent ones that take you on the path you want to follow.
