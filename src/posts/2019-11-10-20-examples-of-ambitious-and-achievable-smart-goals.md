Defining SMART goals is one of the most important steps to success. You need to figure out where you're going so that you can make a plan of how you're going to get there. But if you don't set the right goals, you risk losing focus on what you're trying to achieve.

Unfortunately, there's no one size fits all template for your goals. Everyone has different aspirations and motivations for what they want. I've listed three common objectives below and broken them up in to smaller, measurable tasks that you can use as a framework to tailor your own set of goals.
